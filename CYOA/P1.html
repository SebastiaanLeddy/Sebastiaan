        <p class="p1text">Our hero, very tired after a long day of slaying beasts, enters the small tavern. As you walk in you notice a rowdy group in the corner who looks like they may cause a fight. Though you feel as if your feet will not hold you much longer. Will you walk over <a href="p2Fight.html"> the rowdy boys and try not to add fuel to the fire</a> or <a href="p2hall.html">walk down the hall were you see a shimmering gleam on a table.</a> </p>
